*The structure that allowed plants not to depend on water to reproduce is:
.Fruits
.Polen
.Seeds
.Vascular tissues
*Fruits have an important role in which plant process?
.Dispersion
.Growth
.Competition
.Polination
*The air present inside coconuts probably help them to be dispersed by:
.The Wind
.Birds
.Bats
.The Water
*Which animal behavior can help plants to disperse?
.Foraging 
.Copulation
.Competition
.Fight
*In which plant part does sexual reproduction occur?
.Seeds
.Flowers
.Leaves
.Roots
*Colorful, light with a moderate smell are characteristics of fruits probably dispersed by:
.Water
.Birds
.Mammals 
.Wind
*Light winged seeds are probably dispersed by:
.Birds
.Water
.Mammals
.Wind
*Genetic diversity and species survival are factors ensured by:
.Mitosis
.Reproduction
.Dispersion
.Respiration
*When the environment activates or inactivates different genes of a cell it starts a process called:
.Reproduction
.Differentiation
.Mitosis 
.Meiosis
*The presence of burs of a seed's surface probably help them to be dispersed by:
.Water
.Wind
.Reptiles
.Mammals
*The process that ensures the individual growth, development, and repair of the plant is called:
.Meiosis
.Differentiation
.Mitosis
.Mutation
*A cell with a half set of chromosomes, that usually participates in sexual reproduction, is produced in a process called:
.Differentiation
.Meiosis
.Mitosis
.Budding
*The color and shape of some flowers can attract animals or help them to hide from predators, helping on plant is:
.Dispersion
.Pollination 
.Asexual reproduction
.Growth 
*Some honeybee species are declining, this can harm a process called:
.Competition
.Dispersion 
.Pollination
.Growth
*Flowers that close during day, bloom during night and have strong odour are probably pollinated by:
.Bees
.Birds
.Butterflies
.Bats
*A flower with no odour, no nectar and with petals absent or reduced is probably pollinated by:
.Bees
.Bats
.The wind
.Flies
*A flower with a putrid odour is probably pollinated by:
.Mammals
.Birds
.Flies
.The Wind
*A colorful flower with an abundant amount of nectar, no odour and a large or funnel-like shape is probably pollinated by:
.Bats
.Bees
.Birds
.Flies
*Some flowers like the orchid can mimic the female of an insect to attract mates of the same species, helping the plants with the process of:
.Asexual reproduction
.Sexual reproduction
.Blooming
.Dispersion
*Bright-colored flowers are more likely to be pollinated by:
.The wind
.Nocturnal animals
.Diurnal animals
.The water 
*A process completed with the help of animals or non-biotic factors that guarantees genetic diversity is called:
.Blooming
.Pollination
.Dispersion
.Alternation of generations
*If an animal collects fruits or seeds and loses them afterwards, it will be helping the plant through the process of:
.Pollination
.Sexual reproduction
.Dispersion
.Asexual reproduction
*A reproductive structure that contains an embryo and its’ food supply is called:
.Pollen
.Fruit
.Seed
.Endosperm
*A flower with a wide landing pad and a narrow tube with a deeply hidden nectar is probably pollinated by:
.Butterflies
.Beetles
.Birds
.Bats
*The largest set of pollinating animals and probably the primary visitors of primitive flowering plants are:
.Bees
.Birds
.Beetles
.Flies
*The most efficient pollinator, responsible for keeping the big variety of food available:
.Birds
.Butterflies
.Flies
.Bees
*Bats pollinated plants differ from wind pollinated flowers in having:
.A putrid odour
.Colorful petals
.Abundant nectar
.Funnel-like shape
*Bees pollinated flowers differ from birds pollinated flowers because of:
.A different bloom time 
.The presence of nectar
.The presence of odour
.Having a putrid odour
